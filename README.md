# Spotify_Clone
ðŸŽµ Spotify Clone â€“ A sleek, responsive clone of the Spotify web player, built to mimic core features like music browsing, playlists, and a functional UI. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (add React or any framework if used). This project demonstrates my front-end skills and understanding of dynamic UI/UX design.
